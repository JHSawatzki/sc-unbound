  There's not much time, so let's get you trained ASAP. <a 
  href="event:zombies">Zombies</a> are everywhere. We need to <a 
  href="event:goal">clear</a> the island and <a 
  href="event:resources">resources</a> are limited.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Scrolling</span>\n
  Scout out the area. Scroll the map by moving the mouse outside the
  play area or using the arrow keys.

<p>
  <span class="title">Establish Perimeter</span>\n
  You need a <a href="event:sniper">sniper</a> to defend your <a 
  href="event:depot">depot</a> from the <a 
  href="event:zombies">zombies</a>. Click 'Build Sniper,' then click
  the map to place your sniper tower.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Establish Perimeter</span>\n
  Good. An idle <a href="event:survivors">survivor</a> has been sent
  out with some <a href="event:boards">boards</a> to build the tower.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="title">Establish Perimeter</span>\n
  I'd breathe a lot easier with a second <a href="event:sniper">sniper
  tower</a>. Build another one near the first tower.
</p>


##

<p>
  <span class="title">Establish Perimeter</span>\n
  Your <a href="event:sniper">snipers</a> don't have <a
  href="event:ammo">ammo</a> yet. Wait until both towers are stocked
  up.
#  Don't leave your snipers hanging. Increase your ammo quota to build
#  up a stockpile at your tower, so when the bullets start flying your
#  shooters won't be left out to dry.

  <span class="title">Lure out Zombies</span>\n
  Now that we've got some protection, let's give these crack shots
  something to shoot at. Order one survivor to shoot into the air to
  <a href="event:noise">lure</a> out <a 
  href="event:zombies">zombies</a> from any nearby <a 
  href="event:buildings">buildings</a>.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Lure out Zombies</span>\n
  That's the stuff. Your <a href="event:sniper">snipers</a> should
  make mincemeat from these <a href="event:zombies">living dead</a>.

  <span class="title">Strengthen Perimeter</span>\n
  If the <a href="event:zombies">zombies</a> reach the base of a tower
  you can kiss it goodbye. Some <a 
  href="event:barricade">barricades</a> ought to slow the monsters
  down.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Strengthen Perimeter</span>\n
  Build a second <a href="event:barricade">barricade</a> next to the first.
#  If the zombies reach the base of a tower you can kiss it
#  goodbye. Some barricades ought to slow the monsters down.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Strengthen Perimeter</span>\n
  Build a third <a href="event:barricade">barricade</a>.
#  If the zombies reach the base of a tower you can kiss it
#  goodbye. Some barricades ought to slow the monsters down.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Strengthen Perimeter</span>\n
  A fourth <a href="event:barricade">barricade</a> can block off the
  street completely.
#  If the zombies reach the base of a tower you can kiss it

  <span class="title">Ride Out Attack</span>\n
  Damn, we're running out of time. The <a 
  href="event:timer">counter</a> in the upper left is all the time
  you've got till the next <a href="event:zombie_hordes">horde</a>
  swarms over the bridges. Sit tight and hope those <a 
  href="event:sniper">snipers</a> hold the line.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="title">Expand Perimeter</span>\n
  Close call, but we have to keep moving. Destroy a <a 
  href="event:barricade">barricade</a> so <a 
  href="event:survivors">survivors</a> can move through to the other
  side.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Expand Perimeter</span>\n
  Wait while a <a href="survivor">survivor</a> dismantles the <a 
  href="event:barricade">barricade</a>.

  <span class="title">Expand Perimeter</span>\n
  It's an awful long walk from here back to our first <a 
  href="event:depot">depot</a>. Build another one as a forward supply
  center.

<p>
  <span class="title">Resupply</span>\n
  We need to get this <a href="event:depot">depot</a> stocked before
  those things come back. Build <a href="event:workshop">workshops</a>
  at the entrances to nearby <a href="event:buildings">buildings</a>
  to search for <a href="event:ammo">ammo</a>, <a 
  href="event:boards">boards</a> to build structures, and <a 
  href="event:survivors">survivors</a> to man stations and transport
  <a href="event:resources">resources</a>.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Resupply</span>\n
  That's a good start. Build another <a href="event:workshop">workshop</a>.
#  We need to get this depot stocked before those things come
#  back. Build workshops at the entrances to nearby buildings to search
#  for ammo, boards to build structures, and survivors to man stations

<p>
  <span class="title">Resupply</span>\n
  Build a third <a href="event:workshop">workshop</a>.

  <span class="title">Clear Island of Zombies</span>\n
  Good work. Now keep expanding. Build more <a 
  href="event:sniper">sniper towers</a> to <a 
  href="event:noise">lure</a> out <a href="event:zombies">zombies</a>
  and clear the streets. Build <a href="event:workshop">workshops</a>
  at buildings to send survivors in to bolster your resources. <a 
  href="event:goal">Clear the island</a>.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Destroy Bridge</span>\n
  You've secured the island, but as long as that bridge is up, all
  you've built could be overrun by a <a 
  href="event:zombie_hordes">horde</a> at any moment. Build a <a 
  href="event:workshop">workshop</a> on the <a 
  href="event:charges">charge</a> to blow the bridge and make this a
  permanent sanctuary.
</p>

##

<p>
  <span class="title">Destroy Bridge</span>\n
  Wait for the <a href="event:survivors">survivor</a> to build the <a 
  href="event:workshop">workshop</a>.

<p>
  <span class="title">Destroy Bridge</span>\n
  You're about to be a hero, but don't get cocky. Increase the quota
  at the <a href="event:workshop">workshop</a> to send more people to
  get those <a href="event:charges">charges</a> set faster; you've got
  plenty of <a href="event:survivors">survivors</a> to spare now.
</p>

<p>
  <span class="title">Mission Accomplished</span>\n
  Congrats, soldier: that's one bridge down. Keep it up and there may
  just be hope for humanity yet.

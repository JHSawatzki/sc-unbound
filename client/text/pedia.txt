goal

##

<p><span class="title">Goal</span></p>\n
<p>
  Without safe havens, civilization will be destroyed. Your goal is to
  secure the city by slowly expanding your perimeter, killing <a
  href="event:zombies">zombies</a> and looting <a
  href="event:resources">resources</a> as you go, until you reach and
  destroy each bridge by setting off the <a
  href="event:charges">charges</a> that were airlifted in. Only once
  the island is secure can you think about the future-- and whether
  you'll live to see it.
</p>

##

timer

##

<p><span class="title">Timer</span></p>\n
<p>
  The timer is your friend and your worst enemy. It ticks down the
  precious seconds until the next <a
  href="event:zombie_horde">horde</a> arrives, so keep a close eye on
  it. If you can't take the heat, you can pause the game by
  clicking on the timer.
</p>

##

resources

##

<p><span class="title">Resources</span></p>\n
<p>
  You'll need three things for this mission to succeed: <a
  href="event:boards">lumber</a>, <a href="event:ammo">ammo</a>, and
  fellow <a href="event:survivors">survivors</a>. You'll find these by
  looting the city's eerily quiet <a
  href="event:buildings">buildings</a>. But plan ahead: some types
  contain more of certain resources.
</p>

##

ammo

##

<p><span class="title">Ammo</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_ammo">
  The folks who once lived here had time to stockpile ammunition, but
  in the end it didn't save them. Maybe it will save you. Ammo is one
  of three <a href="event:resources">resources</a> your team is
  searching for in <a href="event:buildings">buildings</a>. Once your
  people get it to a supply <a href="event:depot">depot</a>, it can be
  distributed to your <a href="event:sniper">snipers</a>. You can bet
  your ass they'll need it.
</p>

##

boards

##

<p><span class="title">Boards</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_boards">
  You've ordered your team to strip all spare lumber from any <a
  href="event:buildings">buildings</a> they reconnoiter. Once they
  haul it back to the nearest <a href="event:depot">depot</a>, it will
  fuel your survival: you can order survivors to build <a
  href="event:sniper">sniper towers</a> or <a
  href="event:barricade">barricades</a>. You can even
  upgrade your sniper towers... if there's time.
</p>

##

survivors

##

<p><span class="title">Survivors</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_survivors">
  Anyone left alive is holed up deep inside one of these <a
  href="event:buildings">buildings</a>, scared and hungry. But their
  fear has kept them alive, and they'll be eager to join you, once
  your scouts find them. You can put them to work ferrying <a
  href="event:resources">supplies</a>, scavenging buildings, making <a
  href="event:barricade">fortifications</a>, manning <a
  href="event:sniper">sniper towers</a>, and even setting <a
  href="event:charges">charges</a>. If you survive long enough to
  reach them.
</p>

##

sniper

##

<p><span class="title">Sniper</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_sniper">
  Anyone who's handy with a rifle gets sent to man these towers,
  thrown together from <a href="event:boards">boards</a> and
  sweat. Send more <a href="event:survivors">survivors</a> to a tower
  and they'll act as spotters, increasing the accuracy of your shots;
  and make damn sure your snipers have enough <a 
  href="event:ammo">ammo</a>. If you have the time
  and boards, you can upgrade a sniper tower, building it up higher
  to improve your range.
</p>\n
<p>
  Your snipers are good shots, and sharp: they'll obey tactical orders
  without question, like firing in the air to attract the <a
  href="event:zombies">zombies</a>, or holding fire to avoid a
  swarm. But the towers themselves are rickety scrap heaps; one good
  swipe from those monsters and they'll collapse. So don't let
  them get within swiping distance.
</p>

##

workshop

##

<p><span class="title">Workshop</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_workshop">
  If something needs doing, assign a <a
  href="event:survivors">civvie</a> to the job by building a workshop
  there: at the entrance to a <a href="event:buildings">building</a> 
  to loot it, on a piece of <a href="event:rubble">rubble</a> to clear
  it, or on the bridge <a href="event:charges">charges</a> to prime
  them to blow. Up the quota of survivors at a workshop to get the job done faster. Collected <a
  href="event:resources">resources</a> get taken
  back to the nearest <a href="event:depot">depot</a>, ready to be ferried wherever they're needed.
</p>\n
<p>
  When the job's done, the workshop automatically closes and the
  assigned survivors return to base.
</p>

##

depot

##

<p><span class="title">Depot</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_depot">
  Your command posts and sanctuaries against the <a
  href="event:zombies">horde</a>. All the <a
  href="event:resources">resources</a> and <a
  href="event:survivors">survivors</a> you gather will be staged at
  the nearest depot, and you can only build new structures close by
  a depot which can keep them supplied.
</p>\n
<p>
  As you start to control more area, you should keep a tight eye on
  your supply lines. Each <a href="event:sniper">sniper tower</a> or
  <a href="event:workshop">workshop</a> is connected to a depot; add
  and remove supply lines to make sure your survivors are being routed
  as efficiently as possible.
</p>

##

barricade

##

<p><span class="title">Barricade</span></p>\n
<p>
  <img src="pedia_barricade">
  Unmanned heaps of <a href="event:boards">boards</a> and other junk that should
  hold back the <a href="event:zombies">horde</a>, though not for
  long. Each costs 10 boards to build and will stand up to about that
  many blows from a zombie before it collapses. You can assign <a
  href="event:survivors">survivors</a> to repair them if you act fast,
  and increase the board quota to add durability, but you can only put
  off the inevitable: those things will break through, sooner or
  later.
</p>\n
<p>
  But here's the good news: zombies held up by a barricade are easy
  pickings for your <a href="event:sniper">snipers</a>, and the things
  are usually too stupid to go around them. Put up a barricade between
  your sniper towers and the advancing horde and pick them off like
  ducks in a shooting gallery.
</p>

##

buildings

##

<p><span class="title">Buildings</span></p>\n
<p>
  Whoever once owned them is dead now. Inside are exactly three things
  you care about: <a href="event:boards">lumber</a>, <a
  href="event:ammo">ammo</a>, and <a
  href="event:survivors">survivors</a>. The quicker you can get them
  out, the better your chances. But be careful: <a
  href="event:zombies">zombies</a> are lurking inside too, and any
  loud <a href="event:noise">noise</a> nearby will draw them out into
  the street. To feed.
</p>\n
<p>
  Through initial recon runs you know a little about what's inside
  each building. A green triangle means a cakewalk: plenty of loot and
  no sign of trouble. But yellow, orange, and red triangles point to
  increasing levels of bad news inside: zombies, hiding and waiting in
  the quiet shadows.

  <img src="pedia_zombies">
  Keep two things in mind and you have a chance to stay alive. First,
  their sense of hearing is far more acute than their vision. They're
  attracted by <a href="event:noise">noise</a>-- gunfire or
  construction-- and will mindlessly move towards it. They can <a 
  href="event:scent">smell</a> you too, so keep your distance and
  stay quiet.
</p>\n
<p>
  Second, it only takes one good shot to the head to drop them. On the
  flip side, one bite from those rotten teeth and it's curtains for
  you. If you get within hand-to-hand distance, you're as good as
  dead. Scratch that. You're worse than dead, because soon you'll be
  one of them.

<p>
  These <a href="event:zombies">things</a> seem to like to move in
  packs, or waves. Every so often a new horde will sweep into town
  across a bridge, or swarm out of unexplored buildings angry and
  drooling. The hordes only get bigger each time it happens. Better
  get to those bridge <a href="event:charges">charges</a> fast.
</p>

##

noise

##

<p><span class="title">Noise</span></p>\n
  The <a href="event:zombies">zombies</a> flock to noise like moths to
  flame. Loud noises like gunshots bring them from far away, but
  construction noise wakes up the ones at a medium distance. Remember
  that it's not just the ones in the street you have to worry about;
  most of the <a href="event:buildings">buildings</a> are swarming
  with them too.
</p>

##

scent

<p><span class="title">Scent</span></p>\n
<p>
  Almost anything you'll do makes <a href="event:noise">noise</a>,
  which attracts the <a href="event:zombies">zombies</a>. But those
  bastards can smell you, too. Walk past some and they'll follow your
  scent trail all the way back to base. Noise seems more important to
  them, though; distract them with a loud noise and they'll forget
  about the delicious scent of flesh-- for a while.

<p>
  Keep an eye on the topography around your <a
  href="event:depot">depots</a>. <a
  href="event:survivors">Survivors</a> can't move through <a
  href="event:barricade">barricades</a> or other structures, so make
  sure they have clear paths to work, and run. Mind the urban warfare tradeoff: wide streets make your
  structures harder to defend, and narrow streets make them harder to
  supply. And keep an eye on where the bridges are, since both the <a
  href="event:zombie_hordes">hordes</a> and the <a
  href="event:charges">charges</a> are in that direction.
</p>\n
<p>
  <a href="event:rubble">Destroyed structures</a> block construction,

map_editor

##

<p><span class="title">Map Editor</span></p>\n
<p>
When editing a map, you can click the question mark icon in the
lower-left to access this help again.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Boxes</span></p>\n
<p>
  Boxes represent areas or buildings. The outlines of boxes are shown
  by thin white lines surrounding them. A box might be a single office
  or a street or an area of water.
</p>\n
<p>
  When you create a new map, boxes representing the ocean around an
  island are created for you automatically. You can adjust them or
  move them aside to create bridges. I recommend that you always make
  sure to leave at least the starting amount of water around the edges
  so that the status displays on the edges of the screens do not
  interfere with the player's visibility.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Creating a Box</span></p>\n
<p>
  To create a new box, move the mouse to an empty (white) area of the
  map. Click and drag. A green rectangle will follow your cursor
  showing where the new box will be placed. If the rectangle turns
  red, that means the prospective box overlaps an existing box and
  will not be created. When you have a size that you want, release the
  mouse and a new box will be created.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Resizing a Box</span></p>\n
<p>
  Existing boxes can be resized by dragging their corners. Move the
  mouse so it is inside the box you want to resize near one of the
  corners. Click and drag. You can resize the box to any dimension you
  want. If it overlaps with another box or is too small for the
  current box type, it will turn red.  
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Selecting</span></p>\n
<p>
  Select boxes and squares to edit them. A box or square which is
  selected has a black outline. Click on an unselected box to select
  it. Click within a selected box to select a particular square.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Editing Boxes</span></p>\n
<p>
  You can edit boxes using the combo-box and buttons on the
  left. Click on the box you want to edit. Then click on the combo-box
  widget in the upper-left and select what kind of area you want the
  box to be. Keep in mind that some box types have a minimum size and
  a box must be that size before you can change to those types.
</p>\n

<p>
  All boxes can be deleted using the delete button in the
  lower-left. Buildings can have zombies and resources added to
  them. Some kinds of boxes, like bridges, have a direction which you
  can modify using the rotate and reflect buttons.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Editing Squares</span></p>\n
<p>
  In addition to editing boxes as a whole, individual squares may be
  edited as well. Some buildings allow you to set an entrance anywhere
  on the perimiter. On those boxes, select the square where you want
  the entrance and click 'Set Entrance' on the left.
</p>\n

<p>
  You can also place zombies, rubble, or towers on any square where
  they are normally allowed. You can add obstacles which permanently
  block a square. You can edit the resources available at any tower or
  rubble location. You can also select towers to change their quotas
  or to create and destroy trade links.
</p>\n

<p>
  Finally, you can select a square and remove the obstacle, rubble, or
  tower there with the delete button. To remove zombies just click '-'
  next to the zombie count.
</p>\n

<p><span class="title">Saving, Loading, and Testing</span></p>\n
<p>
  Open the system menu by clicking the system button in the lower-left
  corner. From the system menu, you can save, load, and test the
  current map.
</p>\n

<p>
  When you click "Save Map", the map is encoded into a plain text
  format and displayed in the white text box. You can copy and paste
  that into a file for later use.
</p>\n

<p>
  To load a map, copy a the text for a map into the text box. Make
  sure that the only text in the text box is the map you wish to
  load. Then click "Load Map" to load that map for editing.
</p>\n

<p>
  You can also test a map by clicking "Test Map". When you do, you
  will begin playing the current map. If you win or lose, you will be
  returned to the map editor. You can also end the test by opening the
  system menu and clicking "Edit Map".
</p>

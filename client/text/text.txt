mainIntroText

No one knows how it happened. Soon, there'll be no one left to
care. But the simple truth is that overnight a globe full of civilized
people festered, and changed, and became something less than
civilized. Less than human. And if you weren't the smartest, or the
fastest, or the best-armed on your block, well... you're one of them
now.\n\n

Auriga Squad was the best, and you were its leader. Your final
orders before static filled the airwaves for good were
simple. Parachute onto the island. Secure the city. Blow the
bridges. And set up a secure command post surrounded by water, a safe
haven from the roving, hungry packs.\n\n

But it didn't work out that way. There were so many of them,
lurching through the streets, feeding in dark alleyways. Sure, it only
took one shot to drop them, but it only took one bite to drop you. And
those bites went through flak suits, through Kevlar, through
bone...\n\n

Now everyone is dead. Except you and the handful of civilians
you've rounded up, scared, defiant, looking for a leader. The
explosives sit useless where the airdrop left them, ready to drop the
bridges-- if only someone could reach them.\n\n

What the hell. Maybe there's still a chance. There'll be time to
mourn later, but for now, you'd better get these people moving.
Something tells you this quiet won't last.\n\n

The clock is ticking.

##
mainLoseText

The last board shatters and the monsters surge forward, the
bloodcurdling screams of your dying companions mingling with the
crunching of bone and snarls of inhuman throats, a wall of tattered
clothes and festering flesh and teeth stained lurid red advancing
toward you. And as that last board shatters your hope goes with it,
and you know you've failed. The island has fallen. Another sliver of
humanity corrupted and destroyed.\n\n

Screaming in rage, you draw your last weapon, an eight-inch hunting
knife, and charge straight into the advancing horde, stabbing and
slashing even as claws rip your flesh and teeth begin shattering your
bones. Let no man say Auriga Squad fell without a fight, if there be
men left to say anything at all...

##
mainWinText

The bridge falls into the water, sounds of rending metal and echoes
of the blast reverberating through the city, fading slowly to a
strange, deep silence.\n\n

At first your ragtag team watches numbly, too tired or gripped by
fear to respond, not yet people again, only survivors.\n\n

But then voices begin to murmur, to gasp, to cry out. A cheer
ripples through the crowd and finally explodes, elation shattering
through memories of horror and tears washing cheeks stained with blood
and grime. You've done it. The island is secure.\n\n

Your lips crack as you smile too. Sure, it's only one victory, and
there's a lot more work ahead. But it's something. You've made a haven
against darkness, a place to start to rebuild. Today you've triumphed
against horror. Against despair. Against the horde.
